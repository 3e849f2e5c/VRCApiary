# Unmaintained
Unfortunately I've lost motivation to continue developing this program due to VRChat's removal of a lot of API endpoints for example being able to see who is in an instance, user messaging and being able to put custom URLs as your avatar picture. Also I do not run Windows 10 anymore making it hard to develop further.

# VRCApiary
VRCApiary is a complete rewrite and the successor of the now discontinued VRChat Appi.

Usage of this program requires a [VRChat](https://vrchat.net/) account.
